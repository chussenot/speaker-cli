1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,332
Let's move on to the business axis simplifying and

2
00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:06,458
offering a standard to the teams with good technologies.

3
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:08,388
I'm okay, but this platform is

4
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:10,452
also there to support the business.

5
00:00:10,453 --> 00:00:12,836
It will shape it according to a certain

6
00:00:12,837 --> 00:00:14,868
number of dimensions that will be more or

7
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:17,306
less important depending on the organizations.

8
00:00:17,307 --> 00:00:19,636
For example, if your project is to offer

9
00:00:19,637 --> 00:00:22,458
a public platform for many clients, you won't

10
00:00:22,459 --> 00:00:24,388
have the same requirements as if you are

11
00:00:24,389 --> 00:00:27,330
building an internal platform for your developers.

12
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:30,428
However, there are common dimensions that can

13
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:32,642
be found in almost all platforms.

14
00:00:32,643 --> 00:00:34,012
I have listed some of them.

15
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:37,676
Here we will see dimensions such as ease of use.

16
00:00:37,677 --> 00:00:42,742
Indeed, the idea is to remove a kind of cognitive load.

17
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:44,992
Developers must be able to use this

18
00:00:44,993 --> 00:00:46,678
platform and the pipelines with ease.

19
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,896
But also the platform must provide

20
00:00:48,897 --> 00:00:50,726
a certain level of reliability.

21
00:00:50,727 --> 00:00:52,570
That's what the organization expects.

22
00:00:52,571 --> 00:00:55,300
It wants everything deployed via the platform.

23
00:00:55,301 --> 00:00:59,306
Not to break this platform can have a cost dimension.

24
00:00:59,307 --> 00:01:01,796
Everything deployed on the platform must

25
00:01:01,797 --> 00:01:04,042
be controlled in terms of costs.

26
00:01:04,043 --> 00:01:06,548
The platform will also be required to

27
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:09,028
guarantee a certain level of performance so

28
00:01:09,029 --> 00:01:11,604
that all services respond quickly.

29
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:13,172
This platform will need to be able

30
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,228
to withstand attacks such as Denial of

31
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:18,050
Service or Distributed Denial of service. DDoS.
